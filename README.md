# NCKU Course Tracking

## Introduction
This is a course tracking and automatic choosing program for myself.
Thus, it only can run on Windows 10.

This program has two modes.
The first mode tracks the specified course.
The second mode not only tracks the course but chooses it automatically.
It will send a LINE message after the action is finished.

**It only can automatically choose the course which has been added to the preliminary course schedule manually.**

## Disclaimers
I can not promise if it is banned by the school.
Also, I don't maintain it unless someone reminds me or I recall.
